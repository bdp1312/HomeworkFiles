Rotation: the idea of changing the pointers in a BST such that the tree is "ballenced".
IE: the difference in the distance from the root to each leaf is no more than one.
   It is important to balance a tree efficiently as doing so requires a lot of calculations.

When rotating, there are two cases to consider,
1. a new leaf is added under n.left.left: THEN rotatate right one n

2. a new leaf is added under n.left.right: rotate left on m then rotate right on n
